  <h1>Rapid prototype</h1>
<p>At first, we made a rapid prototype to make our vision clear. We used cardboards to make the prototype.</p>
  <h1>Main body</h1>
  <p>To tell the hotspring's unique charactoristics, we made a box, and on the box, we decided to write letters to describe them.</p>
    <h1>Rotating system</h1>
   <p> Also, we added a motor to rotate so that the customers can see all sides. In addtion, we added a senser and programed it which is the box will rotate only when people are in front of the senser by using one of the Lego tools called EV3.</p>
    <h1>Stand</h1>
<p> Lastly, we made a stand that can hold the main body of our product. We decided to put our product on the Onsen's desk. Therefore, the stand's height was 40cm so that customers can see it easily.</p>

  <h2>This is the product we made during Engineering Design.</h2>
